    "Disease": "Bacterial spot Rot",
    "Symptoms": "
1. Small, water-soaked lesions appear on leaves, stems, and curds (heads). 
2. Lesions grow and turn brown or black, often with a yellow halo. 
3. Infected leaves wilt, turn brown, and may die prematurely. 
4. Bacterial infection causes soft, watery rot on cauliflower curds. 
5. Dark, sunken lesions can develop on stems, causing weakening.",
    "Recommendations(for prevention)": "
1. Start with certified disease-free seeds or transplants. 
2. Remove and destroy plant debris and weeds to reduce sources of infection. 
3. Space plants adequately to ensure good air circulation and reduce humidity. 
4. Use drip irrigation to keep foliage dry and minimize bacterial spread. 
5. Practice crop rotation to prevent the buildup of bacteria in the soil.",
    "Recommendation(For cure and take care)": "
1. Use copper-based bactericides at the first signs of bacterial spot rot. 
2. Uproot and destroy severely infected plants to prevent further spread. 
3. Thin out plants and prune lower leaves to improve airflow and reduce humidity. 
4. Clean tools and equipment to prevent the spread of bacteria. 
5. Frequently inspect plants for symptoms and take prompt action if bacterial spot rot is detected."

    "Plant": "Cauliflower",
    "Disease": "Healthy",
    "Symptoms": "
1. Leaves are a healthy, vibrant green color without spots or discoloration. 
2. Cauliflower heads are compact, firm, and uniform in size. 
3. Stems are sturdy and able to support the weight of the cauliflower heads. 
4. Plants show uniform growth with consistent leaf development. 
5. No visible signs of pests such as holes, webs, or insect activity.",
    "Recommendations(for prevention)": "",
    "Recommendation(For cure and take care)": "
1. Provide consistent and adequate water, ensuring soil moisture remains even. 
2. Apply balanced fertilizer to provide essential nutrients without overfeeding. 
3. Keep the area around cauliflower plants free of weeds to reduce competition for nutrients. 
4. Regularly inspect plants for signs of pests and take appropriate measures if detected. 
5. Ensure cauliflower plants receive full sunlight for at least 
6 hours a day for optimal growth and development."

    "Plant": "Cauliflower",
    "Disease": "Downy Mildow",
    "Symptoms": "
1. Small, yellowish spots appear on the upper surface of leaves. 
2. Undersides of leaves develop a downy white or grayish growth. 
3. Infected leaves may curl downward or inward. 
4. Plants may show reduced vigor and growth. 
4. Leaves infected with downy mildew may drop prematurely.",
    "Recommendations(for prevention)": "
1. Plant cauliflower varieties that are resistant to downy mildew. 
2. Rotate crops to avoid planting cauliflower in the same location year after year. 
3. Space plants adequately to promote air circulation and reduce humidity. 
4. Use drip irrigation or water at the base of plants to keep foliage dry. 
5. Clean up and remove any infected plant debris promptly.",
    "Recommendation(For cure and take care)": "
1. Use fungicides labeled for downy mildew control, such as copper-based sprays. 
2. Remove and destroy severely infected leaves to reduce the spread of the disease. 
3. Prune overcrowded plants to improve airflow and reduce humidity levels. 
4. Regularly inspect plants for early signs of downy mildew and take immediate action if detected. 
5. Harvest cauliflower heads early if downy mildew is detected to salvage unaffected portions of the crop."
